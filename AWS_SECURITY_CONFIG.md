# AWS Security Configuration

## IAM Permissions

### Lambda Execution Role

The serverless framework will automatically create an IAM role with the following permissions:

#### Basic Lambda Permissions

- `logs:CreateLogGroup` - Create CloudWatch log groups
- `logs:CreateLogStream` - Create CloudWatch log streams
- `logs:PutLogEvents` - Write logs to CloudWatch

#### X-Ray Tracing Permissions

- `xray:PutTraceSegments` - Send trace data to X-Ray
- `xray:PutTelemetryRecords` - Send telemetry data to X-Ray

### API Gateway Permissions

- Automatic integration with Lambda functions
- CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests
- Rate limiting: 1000 requests/minute per IP
- Burst limit: 2000 requests

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables Security

- Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- Production environment file (.env.production) excluded from version control
- Environment variables encrypted at rest in Lambda

### 2. CORS Configuration

- Restricted to specific frontend domain (not wildcard in production)
- Proper headers configuration
- Credentials allowed only for authenticated requests

### 3. Rate Limiting

- API Gateway throttling configured
- Reserved concurrency set to 100 to prevent cost overruns
- Burst protection for traffic spikes

### 4. Network Security

- HTTPS enforcement for all communications
- TLS 1.2+ for API Gateway endpoints
- Secure MongoDB Atlas connection with encryption in transit

### 5. Monitoring and Logging

- CloudWatch logging enabled
- X-Ray tracing for performance monitoring
- Log retention set to 7 days for cost optimization
- Error tracking and alerting

### 6. Data Protection

- JWT tokens for authentication
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- Input validation and sanitization
- No sensitive data in logs

## Cost Security Measures

### 1. Resource Limits

- Reserved concurrency: 100 (prevents runaway costs)
- Memory limit: 256MB
- Timeout: 15 seconds
- Log retention: 7 days

### 2. Monitoring

- Cost alerts configured
- Function invocation monitoring
- Error rate monitoring
- Duration monitoring

## Deployment Security Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] AWS credentials configured securely
- [ ] Environment variables validated
- [ ] Sensitive data not in code repository
- [ ] CORS origins properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting configured

### After Deployment

- [ ] Test all endpoints with HTTPS
- [ ] Verify CORS configuration
- [ ] Check CloudWatch logs
- [ ] Validate monitoring alerts
- [ ] Test rate limiting

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident Response

1. **Immediate Actions**

   - Disable affected Lambda function
   - Rotate compromised credentials
   - Check CloudWatch logs for suspicious activity

2. **Investigation**

   - Review X-Ray traces
   - Analyze access patterns
   - Check for data breaches

3. **Recovery**
   - Deploy patched version
   - Update security configurations
   - Notify stakeholders if required

### Cost Overrun Response

1. **Immediate Actions**

   - Check reserved concurrency settings
   - Review CloudWatch metrics
   - Disable function if necessary

2. **Analysis**

   - Identify cost drivers
   - Review traffic patterns
   - Check for DDoS or abuse

3. **Mitigation**
   - Adjust memory/timeout settings
   - Implement additional rate limiting
   - Optimize code performance

## Compliance Notes

### Data Privacy

- User data encrypted in transit and at rest
- No PII in logs or traces
- Secure session management with JWT

### Access Control

- Principle of least privilege for IAM roles
- Environment-based access controls
- Secure credential management

### Audit Trail

- All API calls logged
- CloudWatch metrics retained
- X-Ray traces for debugging
