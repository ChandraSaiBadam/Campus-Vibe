# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a cost-effective AWS deployment strategy for a full-stack web application consisting of a React frontend and Node.js backend. The deployment must handle a maximum of 2000 concurrent users with an average of 300 users, while minimizing AWS costs through optimal service selection and configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to deploy my full-stack application to AWS with minimal costs, so that I can serve my users without exceeding my budget constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the total monthly AWS cost SHALL be under $5 for the specified traffic levels
2. WHEN traffic reaches 300 average users THEN the application SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds
3. WHEN traffic spikes to 2000 concurrent users THEN the application SHALL remain available and responsive
4. WHEN deployment is complete THEN both frontend and backend SHALL be accessible via HTTPS
5. IF traffic exceeds expected levels THEN the system SHALL auto-scale without manual intervention

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment processes, so that I can deploy updates quickly and reliably without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the deployment SHALL trigger automatically
2. WHEN deployment fails THEN the previous version SHALL remain available
3. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the new version SHALL be live within 10 minutes
4. IF deployment scripts are run THEN they SHALL complete without manual intervention
5. WHEN environment variables change THEN they SHALL be updated without downtime

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want monitoring and logging capabilities, so that I can track application performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running THEN basic metrics SHALL be collected automatically
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged and accessible for review
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN alerts SHALL be generated
4. IF costs exceed thresholds THEN notifications SHALL be sent
5. WHEN logs are needed THEN they SHALL be accessible through AWS console

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and reliable access to the application, so that I can use all features without delays or downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the frontend THEN it SHALL load within 3 seconds globally
2. WHEN making API calls THEN they SHALL respond within 2 seconds
3. WHEN the application experiences high traffic THEN uptime SHALL remain above 99.5%
4. IF database queries are made THEN they SHALL complete within 1 second
5. WHEN static assets are requested THEN they SHALL be served from CDN

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious stakeholder, I want the application to follow AWS security best practices, so that user data and application integrity are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is transmitted THEN it SHALL use HTTPS/TLS encryption
2. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL include proper authentication where required
3. WHEN database connections are made THEN they SHALL use encrypted connections
4. IF sensitive data is stored THEN it SHALL be encrypted at rest
5. WHEN AWS resources are created THEN they SHALL follow least-privilege access principles
